GAME START 

When the game starts, we should start with a 10 by 10 grid (SCALABLE). We should have 5 barbarian villages.  
The database should be purged of players. And every spot that is not a barbarian village should be a conquerable spot. 
Whenever a player creates an account, a random conquerable spot on the grid becomes that player's village.
