Grid

The grid should contain villages.
The grid should have conquerable spots (non-villages).
The grid should have barbarian villages (controlled by the game, not players).


Village

Villages should have resources, with resource caps.
Villages should be able to produce resources.
Villages should be able to produce and maintain troops.
Villages should have resource-producing buildings.
Villages should have a village center with non-resource-producing buildings.


GAME START 

When the game starts, we should start with a 10 by 10 grid (SCALABLE). We should have 5 barbarian villages.  
The database should be purged of players. And every spot that is not a barbarian village should be a conquerable spot. 
Whenever a player creates an account, a random conquerable spot on the grid becomes that player's village.


BUILDINGS

I will talk you through my idea. I want different kind of buildings. 
I will want resource productions buildings, that produce resources. 
For example. a Farm produces wheat, a Quarry produces stone, a Mine produces gold, and a Forest produces wood. 
I will want to be able to have 4 of each of these buildings for village (each village should have 4 Forest, 4 Quarry, 4 Mines and 4 Farms. 
I will also want non resource related buildings, like a Pub (to form alliances), a Barracks (to train troops, we will go to troops later lol),
a Grain Silo to store wheat (this will cap how much wheat i can have in my village MAX),
a Storage ( that  will cap how much of the other resources besides wheat i can have on my village MAX),
a Research Center (to unlock more troops, this will be an hell to implement so it will go last),
a Stable (to build troops of type horse) 
and a Siege Workshop (to build troops of type siege).
All building must be constructed.

ok now let's establish some requirements to upgrade buildings ! we should use a good resources curve, so it's engaging to keep evolving your buildings! 
If the buildings would always evolve at the same pace, by the time you would have evolved two or three times it would lose the sense of fun and achievement! 
So we need a good curve. The max level is 10, and they start at level 0. Let's start with our Forests! 
To evolve our forests from level 0 to level 1 we should need like 100 wood, 200 stone, 100 wheat and 50 gold.
And instead of producing 4 wood each hour, they should produce 10 at level 1. You see, thats more than double. It should also take time! 
Every building should take time to evolve. Let's say that it takes 5 minutes for a forest building to evolve from level 0 to level 1.
